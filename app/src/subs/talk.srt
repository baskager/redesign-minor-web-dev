1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm gonna use this as a backdrop 
over what we gonna talk about.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,500
And specifically I want to start with something

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
That was very decisive in our project.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,660
Conversation about personality both that we should have.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,660
I know that many sites. 
 Or many website owners...

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,880
Don't talk about personality.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,500
But I think that if we want to stand out 
 it's the only change to stand out.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,720
To be different, or stand out of the crowd.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,580
And it kinda balls down to how we define

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,040
Websites as a part of our humanity.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,080
Or the other way around...

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,080
That humanity is part of our websites.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,260
So if I ask you now...

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,260
Can you think of a website

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,100
So memorable... 
 That is been so memorable over the last month or so

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,320
Or maybe two months

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
That's still in your head right now.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,320
A website where you can say

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Wow! 
 That was a memorable website.

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,820
Facebook... maybe?

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,740
But is there a website

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,280
That was so impact full on you.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,040
Not necessary in terms of design.

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
But could be in terms of content.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,040
That had a tremendous impact on you.

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,620
That really is stuck of you as of now.
